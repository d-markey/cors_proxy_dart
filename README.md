A tiny CORS proxy written in Dart.

The library provides a `CorsProxy` that listens for requests and forwards them to the remote URL provided when instantiating a proxy instance.
The proxy will add permissive CORS headers so that browsers can access the proxied resources.

Usage
-----

```dart
  // start a local proxy forwarding to `targetUri`
  final proxy = CorsProxy(target: targetUri);
  await proxy.start();
  // the local proxy is listening on `boundPort`
  final boundPort = proxy.boundPort;
```

Example Usage
-------------

Run from the project root:

```bash
dart run example/cors_enabler.dart https://api.target.com/ 8080
```

Then request:

```
http://localhost:8080/path/to/resource
```

Notes
-----

- The proxy supports preflight OPTIONS requests and adds some CORS response headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
- Be warned! It is designed for demonstration and development use; it does not implement advanced security checks or access restrictions.
